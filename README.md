# Coffee_data_Analysis

This is a data visualization and data cleaning practice using Powerbi and Python 


Here "Index.csv" and "delhi.csv" are 2 datasets from kaggle 
"Index.csv" is the Coffeeshop data 
"delhi.csv" is the weather data 
In "analyze.py" data cleaning and formating operations are performed on both "index.csv" and "delhi.csv"
All the changes are saved to "coffee.csv" and "weather.csv"  
After all this a perfect visualization and relationship of this data is shown in "Coffee_Analysis.pbix" which is a PowerBI file.
